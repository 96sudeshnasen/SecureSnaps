# SecureSnaps
Image encryption and Decryption based on private-key cryptography

## Directories:
```
SecureSnaps
---| Enc
---| Dec
---| Temp
```
## Plan
```
Step 1:		Start SecureSnaps
Step 2:		Select (Encrypt/Decrypt)
Step 3:		Input (folder_path, password)
Step 4:		Encrypts/Decrypts the images in the directory and removes the original images
Step 5:		End

```
## Plan for Encryption/Decryption Algorithm
* Add more cascade functions
* Increase the tuple size from 4 elements to 8
* Make the cascade functions non-linear
